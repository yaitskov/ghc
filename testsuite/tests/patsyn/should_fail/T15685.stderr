    • Couldn't match kind ‘a1’ with ‘[k0]’
      When matching types
        f :: a1 -> *
        NP a0 :: [k0] -> *
      Expected: f a2
        Actual: NP a0 b0
        ‘a1’ is untouchable
          inside the constraints: as ~ (a2 : as1)
          bound by a pattern with constructor:

      ‘a1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of HereNil :: NS f as
        at T15685.hs:13:9-15
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘HereNil’
    • In the pattern: Nil
      In the pattern: Here Nil
      In the declaration for pattern synonym ‘HereNil’
