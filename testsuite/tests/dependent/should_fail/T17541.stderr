    • Couldn't match kind ‘Rep rep’ with ‘'IntRep’
      Expected kind ‘TYPE (Rep rep)’, but ‘Int#’ has kind ‘TYPE 'IntRep’
      The type variable ‘rep’ is ambiguous
    • In the type ‘Int#’
      In the type family declaration for ‘Unboxed’
      NB: Type ‘Unboxed’ was inferred to use visible dependent quantification.
      Most types with visible dependent quantification are
      polymorphically recursive and need a standalone kind
      signature. Perhaps supply one, with StandaloneKindSignatures.
