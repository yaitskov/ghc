    • Couldn't match kind ‘k2’ with ‘*’
      When matching types
        a0 :: * -> * -> *

      ‘k2’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          foo :: forall {k2} {k3} (a :: k2 -> k3 -> *) (b :: k2)
                        (m :: k2 -> k3).

    • In the expression: arr return
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = arr return
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: a b (m b) (bound at T9017.hs:8:1)
