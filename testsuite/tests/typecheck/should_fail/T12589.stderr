T12589.hs:13:5: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘t1’
                  with actual type ‘(forall a. Bounded a => f0 a) -> h0 f0 xs0’
      Cannot instantiate unification variable ‘t1’
      with a type involving polytypes:
        (forall a. Bounded a => f0 a) -> h0 f0 xs0
    • In the second argument of ‘(&)’, namely ‘hcpure (Proxy @Bounded)’
      In the expression: minBound & hcpure (Proxy @Bounded)
      In an equation for ‘a’: a = minBound & hcpure (Proxy @Bounded)
