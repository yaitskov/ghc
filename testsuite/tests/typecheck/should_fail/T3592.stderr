    • Couldn't match type ‘a0’ with ‘T a’
      Expected: T a -> String
        Actual: a0 -> String
      Cannot instantiate unification variable ‘a0’
      with a type involving polytypes: T a
    • In the expression: show
      In an equation for ‘f’: f = show
    • Relevant bindings include

T3592.hs:11:7: error:
    • No instance for (Show a) arising from a use of ‘show’
      Possible fix:
        add (Show a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            g :: forall a. T a -> String
    • In the expression: show x
