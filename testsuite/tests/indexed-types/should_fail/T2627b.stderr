    • Could not deduce: Dual (Dual b0) ~ b0
        arising from a use of ‘conn’
      from the context: (Dual a ~ b, Dual b ~ a)
        bound by the type signature for:
                   conn :: forall a b.
                           (Dual a ~ b, Dual b ~ a) =>

      or from: a ~ R c d
        bound by a pattern with constructor:

                 in an equation for ‘conn’

      The type variable ‘b0’ is ambiguous
    • In the expression: conn undefined undefined
      In an equation for ‘conn’:
          conn (Rd k) (Wr a r) = conn undefined undefined
